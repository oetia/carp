repository for me going through the karpathy series on neural networks
i've gone through them before, but this time i want to see how far i can go without referencing any of his videos

1) micrograd - autograd engine wrt scalars
2) 

i think it'd be pretty cool to create the autograd engine w.r.t something like cupy
that way i can implement almost everything from scratch
